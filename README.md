# Travel Blog Website

This is a Web Application that was created as a capstone project for the course "The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp". It's intention was to make a travel blog website so that I can upload a summary for every destination that I've traveled to. This webapp uses a localhost PostgreSQL database, it manages all the CRUD methods to manipulate data for the posts of the website.

## Getting this App up and running
1. Clone this repository
2. Install server packages
```
cd YOUR_PATH/'Project - Blog Web App'
npm install
```
3. Start server
(`nodemon .\index.js`)

The last lines of the output should be
```
[nodemon] starting `node .\index.js`
Server is running on port 3000
```

You can now point your browser to http://localhost:3000/!
